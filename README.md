# Changing the Image Memorability

Supporting code to the paper
[O Sidorov. Changing the Image Memorability: From Basic Photo Editing to GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03825)

First part of the paper relies on [AttGAN](https://github.com/LynnHo/AttGAN-Tensorflow) algorithm in LynnHo's implementation.

Second part utilizes PHOTO_EDITING.m code to mimic conventional photo editing tools. <br>
The code was designed for MATLAB R2017b with Image Processing Toolbox. However, it should also work with reasonably older versions.
