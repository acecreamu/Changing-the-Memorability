# Changing the Image Memorability

Supporting code to the paper<br>
[O Sidorov. Changing the Image Memorability: From Basic Photo Editing to GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03825)

The first part of the paper relies on [AttGAN](https://github.com/LynnHo/AttGAN-Tensorflow) algorithm in LynnHo's implementation.

The second part utilizes `PHOTO_EDITING.m` code to mimic conventional photo editing tools. <br>
The code was designed for MATLAB R2017b with Image Processing Toolbox. However, it should also work with reasonably older versions.

The third part implemented using Photoshop reconstruction of Instagram filters by SparkleStock.
